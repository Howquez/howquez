### Hi there 👋

- 🎓 I am a PhD candidate at the _Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society_ [(CLICCS)](https://www.cliccs.uni-hamburg.de/), where I investigate how social systems cope with climate-related uncertainties and variabilities. In addition, I am a Doctoral Research Associate at the [Institute of Behavioral Science and Technology](https://www.ibt.unisg.ch/) at the University of St. Gallen.
- 🕵️‍♂️ I was working as a web analyst at [SinnerSchrader](https://sinnerschrader.com/) (called Accenture Song nowadays).
- 📫 send me an [eMail](mailto:hauke.roggenkamp@unisg.ch) and find me on 💼 [linkedin]() or 🚴 [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/20973736).
