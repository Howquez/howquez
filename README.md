### Hi there 👋

- 🎓 I am a PhD candidate at the _Cluster of Excellence Climate, Climatic Change, and Society_ [(CLICCS)](https://www.cliccs.uni-hamburg.de/), where I investigate how social systems cope with climate-related uncertainties and variabilities.
- 🕵️‍♂️ I am also working as a web analyst at [SinnerSchrader](https://sinnerschrader.com/) where I try to make customers happy by learning to understand their visitors.
- 🔭 I am currently working on [an economic experiment](https://github.com/Howquez/forecast-uncertainty) investigating the respondents ambiguity attitudes.
- ⛈ In addition, I prepare a [dynamic public goods game](https://github.com/Howquez/coopUncertainty) (also an economic experiment) and think about the incorporation of uncertainty to model cooperation in the light of increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events.
- 📫 send me an [eMail](mailto:roggenkh@hsu-hh.de) and find me on 💼 [linkedin]() or 🚴 [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/20973736).
